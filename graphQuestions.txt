Most questions below refer to the Graph.pdf file included with the starter code for this assignment. Graph.pdf shows the same graph used in part 1 of this assignment. That graph is referred to as G in this document.

For questions 1 to 6 below answer TRUE or FALSE.

Q1.  Graph G is a digraph. False

Q2.  Graph G is acyclic. False

Q3.  Graph G is a weighted graph. True

Q4.  Graph G is a complete graph. False

Q5.  In graph G, vertex 1 (Aberdeen) is reachable from vertex 4 (Kennewick). True

Q6.  Graph G is a connected graph. True


For questions 7 to 10 below provide short answers.

Q7.  What is the cardinality of the vertex set (|V|) in graph G? 10

Q8.  List the vertices that are adjacent to vertex 9 (Tacoma) in graph G. 5, 7, and 10

Q9.  What is the in-degree of vertex 8 (Spokane) in graph G? 3

Q10. What is the cost of the simple path {7, 6, 1} in graph G? 109 the shortest path is to go 7 to 1 is by adding the distance 50+28+31=109


Questions 11 - 14 refer to DFS and BFS

Q11. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a depth first search (DFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle). You may show either the node numbers or the city names. 
7, 2, 6, 1, 5, 9, 10, 4, 8, 3

Q12. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of DFS? Stack

Q13. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a breadth first search (BFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle). You may show either the node numbers or the city names. 
7, 2, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 10, 5, 4

Q14. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of BFS? Queue


Question 15 and 16 below refer to the starter code provide with this assignment.

Q15. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the minimalPath() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.
To get the minimal cost path from the vertex theSource to the vertex theDestination of the graph by assuming edge weights are positive. The minimalPath() method helps to find the diameter and the pathLength in the DisplayCostsMain class. 

Q16. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the floydShortestPaths() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.
 floydShortestPaths()methods also helps to get the shortest-path of the graph. It also help to calculate the vertex of the directed weighted graph.

For questions 17 through 20, match the name of the algorithm to the problem in graph theory it is designed to solve (from the A to F list below). You may need to do a bit of research on the Internet to answer these questions. NOTE: below the list of questions is a list of various problems.

Q17. Dijkstra's algorithm. B

Q18. Prim's algorithm. A

Q19. Kruskal's algorithm. A

Q20. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm. E


For reference, here is a list of problems in graph theory:
A) Minimum spanning tree 
B) Single-source shortest paths (graph without negative edge weights) 
C) Single-source shortest paths (graph may include negative edge weights) 
D) Maximum flow in a flow network 
E) All pairs shortest paths
F) Topological sort
